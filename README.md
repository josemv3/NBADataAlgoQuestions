# NBADataAlgoQuestions

Mentor lead algorithms and data structure testing. 
CSV file to data model using dictionaries to hold data.

In this lesson, I was tasked with taking NBA Finals data in a CSV file and using the data to 
answer algorithm questions. 

I created a struct: NBAFinals object, to hold each piece of data in the CSV file and held the 
NBAFinals objects in a dictionary with the key being the NBA Finals year. 


Extra notes:
After iterating through the dictionary with for loops, I found a new way to construct the data 
in a dictionary that allowed me to create algorithms that utilized constant time search speed. 
I applied this more efficient version in the Top Movies Algorithm challenges.
